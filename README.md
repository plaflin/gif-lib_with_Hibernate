# gif-lib_with_Hibernate
Basic Full Stack program using Java, Spring, Hibernate, and H2 database to store gif files.  

This project is from TeamTreehouse. It was a little dated when I started working on it the other day.
I had to troubleshoot to find out why it wasn't working when I followed along with the videos.
It works now that the dependencies and build file are up to date.
